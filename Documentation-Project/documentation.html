          <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS, what the basic syntax looks like, and how your browser applies CSS to HTML to style it.</p>
          <p>CSS can be used for many purposes related to the look and feel of your web page. The most important are:</p>
          <li>Text styling, for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links.</li>
          <li>Creating layouts, for example, turning a single column of text into a multiple-column layout.</li>
          <li>Special effects such as animation.</li>
          
          <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular element or groups of elements on your web page.</p>
          <p>
For example, you might decide to style the main heading on your page as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve this:</p>

          <code>h1 { 
            color: red; 
            font-size: 2.5em;
            }</code>

        <article>
          <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.</p>
        
          <code> h1 { 
            color: blue; 
            background-color: yellow;
            }</code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Atribute_Selectors">
        <header>Atribute Selectors</header>
        <article>
          <p>As you know from your study of HTML, elements can have attributes that give further detail about the element being marked up. In CSS you can use attribute selectors to target elements with certain attributes. </p>

          <p>
            In the example below you can see these selectors being used:
          </p>
          
          <li>By using li[class] we can match any list item with a class attribute. This matches all of the list items except the first one.</li>
          <li>li[class="a"] matches a selector with a class of a, but not a selector with a class of a with another space-separated class as part of the value. It selects the second list item.</li>
          <li>li[class~="a"] will match a class of a but also a value that contains the class of a as part of a whitespace-separated list. It selects the second and third list items.</li>
          
          <code>body {
              font-family: sans-serif;
            }

            li[class] {
              font-size: 120%;
            }

            li[class="a"] {
              background-color: yellow;
            }

            li[class~="a"] {
              color: red;
            }</code>
        </article>

      <section class="main-section" id="Combinators">
        <header>Combinators</header>
        <article>
          <p>The final selectors we will look at are called combinators. Combinators are used to combine other selectors in a way that allows us to select elements based on their location in the DOM relative to other elements (for example, child or sibling).</p>
          <p>
            The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single space ( ) character — combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor (parent, parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc.) element matching the first selector. Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.
          </p>
          <code>body article p {
            }</code>

        <header>Sizing</header>
        <article>
          <p>HTML Elements have a natural size, set before they are affected by any CSS. A straightforward example is an image. An image file contains sizing information, described as its intrinsic size. This size is determined by the image itself, not by any formatting we happen to apply.
            </p>
            <p>
If you place an image on a page and do not change its height or width, either by using attributes on the <img> tag or else by CSS, it will be displayed using that intrinsic size. We have given the image in the example below a border so that you can see the extent of its size as defined in its file.</p>
         
          <code>img {
  border: 5px solid darkblue;
}</code>
